The dataset includes 6605 images.
Car-logos are annotated in COCO format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 480x480 (Stretch)
* Auto-contrast via adaptive equalization

The following augmentation was applied to create 2 versions of each source image:
* Random shear of between -15째 to +15째 horizontally and -15째 to +15째 vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -2 and +2 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -2 and +2 percent
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 1 percent of pixels
